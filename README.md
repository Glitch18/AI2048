## Training an AI to play 2048

We build a game similar to 2048. Tiles have been custom made in Photoshop.
This game can be independently played by the user, without the neural network.
Just execute the Game.py file.

Neural Network to be added soon.

I designed a Deep Q network to be trained to play the game. As input, the 4x4 game tiles will be fed to it as a 2D array.
Which passes through the fully connected layer of the DQN. We make decisions based on exploitation or exploration. 

Improving the DQN is in progress.
